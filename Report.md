# Overview

Reported here is a brief analysis of a deep learning model's capabilities of predicting applicants most likely to produce successful outcomes should they receive funding from the Alphabet Soup foundation based on past data of organizations previously funded by Alphabet Soup.

# Results Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

## Data Preprocessing

The funding outcome model aims to predict if a potential candidate for funding is successful or not.

The model uses a wide variety of information on the candidate from past data which includes application type, affiliation with other companies, government organization classification, purpose of funding, organization type, current status based on activity, current income, the presence of special considerations, the requested funds, and outcome after receiving funds (successful or unsuccessful).

The only information irrelevant to the model are any identification markers of the organization which include EIN and Name. These should be independent of the outcome after receiving funds.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
